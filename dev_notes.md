# Scanning Module Updates

## Fallback and Fusion Mechanism Enhancements

- Implemented a robust fallback mechanism in the ScanningController:
  - Uses LiDAR as primary scanning method.
  - Falls back to Photogrammetry if LiDAR quality is below threshold.
  - Enables hybrid fusion when both sources are available and quality metrics are within acceptable thresholds.
  - Monitor quality scores (point density, depth consistency, feature matching, etc.) to trigger fallback transitions.
  - Exponential backoff is applied when switching scanning modes, and notifications are sent on scanning mode changes.

These changes are reflected in the `ScanningController.swift` and integrated with existing quality and fusion metrics evaluation.
