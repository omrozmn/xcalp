# Platform Integration Blueprint

## 1. Development Priority Order
1. Infrastructure Setup
   - API Gateway
   - Database Clusters
   - Security Services
   - Cloud Resources

2. Platform-Specific Development
   - Each platform developed independently
   - Native components and implementations
   - Platform-specific optimizations
   - Independent release cycles

## 2. Shared Infrastructure

### 2.1 API Gateway
- RESTful endpoints
- GraphQL interface
- WebSocket connections
- Rate limiting
- Load balancing

### 2.2 Database Infrastructure
- Main database clusters
- Read replicas
- Caching layer
- Backup systems
- Data warehousing

### 2.3 Security Infrastructure
- Authentication services
- Authorization framework
- Encryption services
- Audit logging
- Compliance monitoring

### 2.4 Cloud Infrastructure
- Compute resources
- Storage solutions
- CDN setup
- Monitoring systems
- Disaster recovery

## 3. Platform Independence

### 3.1 Native Development
