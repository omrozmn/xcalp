-  Steps to build 
1.	Planning & Requirements Gathering
	•	Define the project purpose, target audience, and core features.
	•	Gather and document user stories and functional requirements.
	•	Identify technical requirements, constraints, and dependencies (e.g., frameworks, APIs). Use ready it repories whenever possible
	2.	Research & Design
	•	Study similar successful apps and design guidelines (Apple Human Interface Guidelines).
	•	Create wireframes and mockups (using Sketch, Figma, or similar tools).
	•	Decide on the app architecture (e.g., MVVM, VIPER, or using the Composable Architecture).
	3.	Setting Up the Development Environment
	•	Install the latest version of Xcode and necessary command line tools.
	•	Configure Git for version control and set up a repository.
	•	Set up continuous integration (CI) tools for automated builds and tests.
	4.	Project Initialization & Structure
	•	Create a new Xcode project and choose the appropriate project template.
	•	Define your project directory structure (e.g., separating features, core modules, resources, tests).
	•	Add dependencies using Swift Package Manager, CocoaPods, or Carthage.
	5.	Core Implementation
	•	Start by building the core functionality or data layer (model, services, network communication).
	•	Implement business logic and domain models.
	•	Write unit tests for your core components.
	6.	User Interface Development
	•	Develop UI components using SwiftUI or UIKit.
	•	Integrate with the core business logic using a chosen architectural pattern.
	•	Add UI tests to validate user interactions.
	7.	Integration & Feature Development
	•	Gradually integrate each feature, starting with the simplest ones.
	•	Use a step-by-step approach: implement a feature, test it thoroughly, and ensure it integrates well with the existing code.
	•	Continuously run automated builds and tests to catch issues early.
	8.	Performance Optimization & Error Handling
	•	Profile the app using Xcode Instruments to identify performance bottlenecks.
	•	Optimize memory usage, network requests, and animations.
	•	Implement robust error handling and logging throughout the app.
	9.	User Testing & Feedback
	•	Run beta tests with real users (TestFlight).
	•	Gather feedback on usability and functionality.
	•	Iterate on the design and features based on feedback.
	10.	Final Validation & Deployment
	•	Perform final QA and extensive testing (unit, UI, integration, performance).
	•	Prepare app metadata, screenshots, and descriptions.
	•	Submit the app to the App Store for review and release.
